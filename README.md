# Collection_Framework
Colection Framework: provides a set of interfaces and classes to handle and manipulate groups of objects. It offers a wide range of data structures and algorithms that are used for storing, managing, and processing collections of objects efficiently.

1. List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Implementations include ArrayList and LinkedList.
2. Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
3. Queue: A collection that holds elements prior to processing. Implementations include LinkedList, ArrayDeque, and PriorityQueue.
4. Map: An object that maps keys to values. Implementations include HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, and Hashtable.
